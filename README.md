# Thermal-Science-Projects
A collection of thermal engineering simulations solved analytically, numerically (Python), and validated using ANSYS — covering conduction, convection, radiation, and fins.

This repository contains a series of Thermal Science & Heat Transfer projects developed as part of my learning and research in Thermal Engineering.
Each project begins with the analytical formulation, followed by a numerical solution using Python (NumPy + Matplotlib), and finally a validation through ANSYS when applicable.

The aim is to connect theoretical understanding with computational and simulation tools.
